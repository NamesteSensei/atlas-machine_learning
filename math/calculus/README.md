Welcome to the **Atlas Machine Learning** project repository! This repository contains resources and exercises for exploring advanced mathematical concepts and their applications in machine learning.

## Project Structure

- **Directory:** `math/calculus`
  - This directory focuses on calculus concepts including summation notation, series, derivatives, and integrals.
- Each task is designed to teach core calculus principles through practical examples.

## Current Task

### 0. Sigma is for Sum
- **Objective:** Solve the summation `âˆ‘_{i=2}^{5} i`, which represents the sum of integers from 2 to 5.
- **Solution:** This task demonstrates how summation notation works, resulting in the value `14`.

## How to Run the Project
1. Navigate to the required directory:
   ```bash
   cd math/calculus
